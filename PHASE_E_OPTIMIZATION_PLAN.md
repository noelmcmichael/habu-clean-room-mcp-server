## 🏗️ **Phase E1: Architecture Documentation Update (20 minutes)**

### **Current Issues**
- Architecture page still references mock data functionality
- Missing Phase D enhancements (enhanced templates, real API optimization)
- Component descriptions need updating for current state

### **Technical Changes**
- Update `Architecture.tsx` component descriptions
- Remove mock data references

## 🏢 **Phase E2: Cleanrooms Page Enhancement (30 minutes)**

### **Current Issues**
- Uses basic templates/partners data display
- Still shows "Habu Cleanrooms" title (should be "LiveRamp Cleanrooms")
- Missing enhanced template metadata we now have available
- References to mock data partners that don't exist

### **Technical Changes**
- Update page title from "Habu Cleanrooms" to "LiveRamp Cleanrooms"
- Integrate with enhanced templates API (`/api/mcp/habu_enhanced_templates`)
- Show rich template metadata (parameters, data types, complexity)
- Remove mock data partner references
- Add business intelligence summary cards
- Display template readiness status and recommendations

### **Expected Outcome**
- Professional cleanrooms page with rich metadata
- Accurate branding and no mock data references
- Enhanced user experience with actionable insights

## 🎨 **Phase E3: Branding Updates (15 minutes)**

### **Current Issues**
- "Habu AI" in top left should be "ICDC"
- Various "Habu" references throughout UI

### **Technical Changes**
- Update `App.tsx` logo text from "Habu AI" to "ICDC"
- Review and update any remaining "Habu" references in UI text
- Ensure consistent branding throughout application

### **Expected Outcome**
- Consistent ICDC branding throughout application
- Professional appearance aligned with client requirements

## 🧹 **Phase E4: UI Cleanup (10 minutes)**

### **Current Issues**
- Demo system status box floating over home page is redundant
- System Health page already provides this information

### **Technical Changes**
- Remove or conditionally hide `DemoStatusIndicators` component from ChatInterface
- Clean up related CSS and component references
- Streamline home page layout

### **Expected Outcome**
- Cleaner home page without redundant status information
- Improved user experience with less clutter
