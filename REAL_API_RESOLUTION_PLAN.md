# üîß Real API Resolution - Phased Plan

## **Current Status Assessment**
- ‚úÖ Authentication working (OAuth2, valid JWT tokens)
- ‚úÖ 25 comprehensive permissions including read/write cleanrooms
- ‚úÖ API connectivity confirmed (other endpoints working: `/users`, `/data-connections`)
- ‚ùå Cleanroom endpoint returns empty array `[]`
- üîß Currently using mock data for demonstrations

## **Phase 1: Baseline API Testing & Verification** (30 minutes)
**Goal**: Confirm current API connectivity and establish baseline of what works/doesn't work

### 1.1 Authentication Verification
- [ ] Test OAuth2 flow with current credentials
- [ ] Verify JWT token is valid and has expected permissions
- [ ] Check token expiration and refresh capabilities
- [ ] Document exact authentication headers being sent

### 1.2 Known Working Endpoints Test
- [ ] `/users` - List users (should work based on history)
- [ ] `/data-connections` - List data connections (should work)
- [ ] `/profile` or `/me` - Current user information
- [ ] Document exact response structure for working endpoints

### 1.3 Cleanroom Endpoint Deep Dive
- [ ] Test `/cleanrooms` endpoint with various parameters
- [ ] Test with different HTTP headers
- [ ] Test with different query parameters (filters, pagination)
- [ ] Document exact request/response for failed cleanroom calls

**Deliverables**:
- Baseline API test report
- Working vs non-working endpoint comparison
- Authentication verification report

---

## **Phase 2: API Exploration & Permission Analysis** (45 minutes)
**Goal**: Understand API structure, permissions, and potential cleanroom access patterns

### 2.1 User Context Investigation
- [ ] Analyze current user's organizational context
- [ ] Check user permissions and roles
- [ ] Verify user's access to cleanroom functionality
- [ ] Test if user needs to be in specific organization/role

### 2.2 Alternative Cleanroom Endpoints
- [ ] Test `/organizations/{org_id}/cleanrooms`
- [ ] Test `/users/{user_id}/cleanrooms`
- [ ] Test `/projects` or `/workspaces` endpoints
- [ ] Search for cleanroom-related endpoints in API documentation

### 2.3 API Schema Discovery
- [ ] Test OpenAPI/Swagger endpoint if available
- [ ] Enumerate available endpoints via OPTIONS requests
- [ ] Test different API versions (v1 vs v2)
- [ ] Document complete API structure

**Deliverables**:
- Complete API endpoint inventory
- User permission analysis
- Alternative access pattern identification

---

## **Phase 3: Cleanroom Creation & Management Testing** (60 minutes)
**Goal**: Test if we can create cleanrooms or if visibility issues are due to empty state

### 3.1 Cleanroom Creation Testing
- [ ] Test POST `/cleanrooms` to create a test cleanroom
- [ ] Use minimal required parameters for cleanroom creation
- [ ] Test with different cleanroom types/configurations
- [ ] Document creation process and requirements

### 3.2 Cleanroom Management Operations
- [ ] If creation works, test listing cleanrooms again
- [ ] Test GET `/cleanrooms/{id}` for specific cleanroom
- [ ] Test PUT/PATCH operations on created cleanrooms
- [ ] Test DELETE operations (cleanup)

### 3.3 Data Integration Testing
- [ ] Test linking data connections to cleanrooms
- [ ] Test partner data sharing setup
- [ ] Test query submission to created cleanrooms
- [ ] Verify end-to-end workflow functionality

**Deliverables**:
- Cleanroom creation/management test results
- Working cleanroom workflow documentation
- Test cleanroom for further development

---

## **Phase 4: Integration & UI Transition** (45 minutes)
**Goal**: Switch from mock data to real API in the demo interface

### 4.1 API Configuration Update
- [ ] Update MCP server to use real API endpoints
- [ ] Switch HABU_USE_MOCK_DATA to false
- [ ] Update error handling for real API responses
- [ ] Add fallback mechanisms for failed API calls

### 4.2 UI Testing with Real Data
- [ ] Test React frontend with real API responses
- [ ] Update UI components to handle real data structures
- [ ] Test error states and loading scenarios
- [ ] Verify all 8 MCP tools work with real API

### 4.3 Demonstration Preparation
- [ ] Create sample cleanrooms for demo purposes
- [ ] Test complete user workflows
- [ ] Document known limitations vs mock data
- [ ] Prepare fallback scenarios

**Deliverables**:
- Fully functional real API integration
- Updated demo interface
- Production-ready configuration

## **Tools & Scripts for Each Phase**

### Debug Scripts Available
- `tools/debug_habu_api.py` - Comprehensive API debugging
- `debug_cleanrooms.py` - Cleanroom-specific debugging
- `decode_jwt.py` - JWT token analysis
- `deep_api_debug.py` - Deep API exploration

### New Tools to Create
- `phase1_baseline_test.py` - Automated baseline testing
- `phase2_api_explorer.py` - Comprehensive API discovery
- `phase3_cleanroom_tester.py` - Cleanroom CRUD operations
- `phase4_integration_test.py` - End-to-end integration testing

---

## **Success Criteria**

### Phase 1 Success
- ‚úÖ Confirmed working endpoints documented
- ‚úÖ Cleanroom endpoint issue clearly identified
- ‚úÖ Authentication verified as working

### Phase 2 Success  
- ‚úÖ Complete API endpoint map created
- ‚úÖ User permissions fully understood
- ‚úÖ Alternative cleanroom access patterns identified

### Phase 3 Success
- ‚úÖ Test cleanroom successfully created OR
- ‚úÖ Clear understanding of why cleanroom creation fails
- ‚úÖ Working cleanroom workflow documented

### Phase 4 Success
- ‚úÖ Real API fully integrated in demo interface
- ‚úÖ All MCP tools working with real data
- ‚úÖ Demo ready for stakeholder presentation

---

## **Risk Mitigation**

### If Cleanrooms Remain Inaccessible
- Keep enhanced mock data as fallback
- Document API limitations for stakeholders
- Focus on other API endpoints that work
- Prepare hybrid demo (real data where available, mock where needed)

### If API Access Issues Arise
- Verify credentials haven't expired
- Check for API rate limiting
- Test with different user accounts if available
- Contact Habu support with specific technical details

## **Expected Timeline**
- **Phase 1**: 30 minutes (baseline verification)
- **Phase 2**: 45 minutes (API exploration)  
- **Phase 3**: 60 minutes (cleanroom testing)
- **Phase 4**: 45 minutes (integration)
- **Total**: ~3 hours for complete resolution

Let's start with Phase 1!
