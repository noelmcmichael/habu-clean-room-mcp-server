# ðŸŽ¯ POST-DEPLOYMENT SETUP

## After Successful Render Deployment

### Immediate Testing (5 minutes)

**1. Run Deployment Success Check:**
```bash
cd /Users/noelmcmichael/Workspace/streamable_http_mcp_server
python3 check_deployment_success.py
```

**2. Access Your Live Application:**
```
Frontend: https://habu-demo-frontend-v2.onrender.com
```

### Enhanced UX Features to Test

**Customer Support Mode:**
- Click "Lookalike Modeling" quick action
- Test mode switching to Technical Expert
- Verify contextual suggestions appear in chat input
- Check real-time metrics in header
- Test message actions (copy, regenerate, feedback)

**Technical Expert Mode:**  
- Click "Identity Resolution API" quick action
- Verify code examples render with syntax highlighting
- Test quick actions generate appropriate technical responses
- Check mobile responsiveness on phone/tablet

**Mobile Testing:**
- Open on mobile device
- Verify touch-optimized interface
- Test expandable input functionality
- Confirm all features work on small screens

### VS Code Integration Setup

**Update `.vscode/mcp.json`:**
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "liveramp-ai-assistant": {
      "url": "https://habu-mcp-server-v2.onrender.com/mcp/",
      "headers": {
        "X-API-Key": "secure-habu-demo-key-2024"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Test VS Code Integration:**
In GitHub Copilot Chat:
```
@liveramp-ai-assistant List my clean room partners
@liveramp-ai-assistant Show audience overlap analysis
@liveramp-ai-assistant What API integration issues are common?
```

### Performance Monitoring

**Key Metrics to Monitor:**
- Frontend load time: < 3 seconds
- API response time: < 2 seconds  
- Mobile performance: Smooth scrolling and interactions
- Enhanced UX components: All quick actions functional

**Monitor via Render Dashboard:**
- Check CPU and memory usage
- Review error logs for any issues
- Monitor request volume and response times
