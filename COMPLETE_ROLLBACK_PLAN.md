# ðŸš¨ COMPLETE CDN ROLLBACK PLAN

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Critical Issues**
- Cleanrooms page: Slow loading â†’ empty page (no errors)
- Chat assistant: 404 errors on submit button
- Performance worse than before optimization
- CDN layer adding complexity without benefit

## âœ… **Decision: Complete CDN Removal**
Remove ALL CDN optimization and revert to stable Redis-only version that was working in Phase H1.1

## ðŸ“‹ **Rollback Steps**

### **Step 1: Revert API to Pre-CDN State**
- Remove all `cdn_optimization.py` imports and calls
- Remove `apply_cdn_optimization()` functions
- Use simple `jsonify()` returns
- Keep only Redis caching (which was working)

### **Step 2: Revert Frontend to Stable State**
- Remove CDN metrics component completely
- Restore working lazy loading if needed
- Remove any CDN-related imports
- Test page loading

### **Step 3: Restore Core Functionality**
- Ensure chat endpoint works (fix 404 errors)
- Ensure cleanrooms page loads with data
- Verify all basic functionality

### **Step 4: Verify Stability**
- Test from multiple locations
- Confirm no 404/500 errors
- Validate performance is acceptable
