# Phase F: Advanced AI Assistant Optimization Plan

## üéØ **Current State Analysis**

### **Strengths**
- GPT-4 powered chat agent with business intelligence
- Real API integration with enhanced template metadata
- Professional ICDC design with clean interface
- Production deployment with all services online

### **Identified Improvement Areas**
1. **Generic Suggested Prompts**: Current prompts are static and not context-aware
2. **Limited Contextual Responses**: Chat responses could be more specific to user's current state
3. **Workflow Guidance Gap**: Users need better guidance through multi-step analytics workflows
4. **Template-Specific Intelligence**: Responses should be more tailored to specific template capabilities
